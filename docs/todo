backup to db?

-Pros
persistence on reboot
    - you can't play the game when the server is down anyway
    - restarts will be infrequent
    - connection time alive won't be accurate
    - 
-cons
like, so much dumb checking to do in the background
    -cmon girl, it's like, two files need to be updated, 2 schemas and you're synced
latency to board will be further increased
    -only on board connection, 

board will need to be dumped and resynced on start, heroku has daily restarts >:(
